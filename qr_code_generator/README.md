# QR Code Generator

This is a simple web application built with Flask to generate and download QR codes based on user input.
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation


1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sazzadulalambd/Flask-Project.git
   cd Flask-Project/qr_code_generator
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.**

3. **Enter text or a URL in the input field and click on "Generate QR Code".**

4. **A QR code will be displayed. Click on "Download QR Code" to download the QR code as a PNG file.**

## Deployment to Production

For deploying this Flask application to a production environment, it's recommended to use a WSGI server like Gunicorn. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Install Gunicorn (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. **Start Gunicorn server:**

   Run the following command to start Gunicorn:

   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 app:app
   ```

   - `-w 4` specifies the number of worker processes (adjust as needed).
   - `-b 127.0.0.1:5000` binds Gunicorn to listen on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) port `5000`.
   - `app:app` specifies the module (`app`) and the Flask instance (`app`) to run.

3. **Accessing the deployed application:**

   Your Flask application will now be accessible through Gunicorn at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or the appropriate hostname and port configured for your server.
